# Image-Analysis-of-Particles
This project involves using MATLAB code to efficiently find out the particle size profile present in the image even when particles are overlapping.

## Using MATLAB
For this project, I used MATLAB software. In the MATLAB software, firstly I uploaded the image for which I want to know its particle size distribution(PSD).

### What is Particle size distribution (PSD) :- 
Basically, in this we plot a graph between number of particles with respect to its size(in nanometers).

### Application in real life scenario :- 
1. Pharmaceutical Industry :- In drug development, PSD analysis helps in formulating dosage forms with optimal bioavailability and stability.
  
2. Environmental Science :- PSD analysis of airborne particulate matter is critical for assessing air quality and health risks associated with inhalable pollutants.

## Made validation through using ImageJ software :- 
Output number of particles predicted by the MATLAB code exactly matches with the number of particles obtained in the ImageJ software for the same image.
